calculation of ship motions and wave
loads to the practical ship design,
it is necessary to confirm the agree-
ment between prediction and experiment.
Tests were carried out using ship
models and the results were compared
•with the theoretical predictions
based on the strip method. The kinds
of tests were forced oscillation model
tests in calm water to check the co-
efficients of the equations of ship
motions^ restrained model tests in
oblique waves to check the terms of
wave excitation and free model tests
in oblique waves to check the ampli-
tudes of ship motions.
It is pointed out that the estimation
of roll damping- is the most important
and its proper approximation method
should be developed for making a bet-
ter prediction. Moreover, it is
pointed out that investigations should
be carried out for ship motions among
the waves of larger wave height so as
to be able to predict and maintain
the stability and safety of a ship in
rough sea. »",

Formed the background for studies of
i. lie capsize of a coastal tanker in bal-
last condition, which complied with
the IMCO recommendations for transverse
stability^
Model tests were performed with a four
metre wooden model in a l6 million
litre model basin equipped with a dig-
i tally controlled pneumatic wave gener-
atora
The reconstruction of the capsize in
ballast condition was successful and
was extended to higher G-M values than
that recommended by the IMCO regulations,
Fully loaded it was not possible to cap-
size the model vhen it was even at much
lower GM values than recommended., Wind
(mean) and gust effects were simulated^
Hard facts regarding the limit GM in
the test environments were obtained®
A deeper analysis was subsequently at-
tempted, with concentration on the ob-
served ultimate half period of roll
which progressed directly into the cap-
size .
An energy and moment balance analysis,
using righting levers which varied
during the wave passage, mean wind and
gust moments and non-cancelling wave-
forcing and motion-damping moments, did
not explain the capsize®
The well-established effect of coupling
moments into roll from heave and pitch
and wave passage, described by the
Mathieu type of equations, was not effective, because of the lack of nec~
essary 2tl tuning ratio for the wave
encounter,,
A Faltinsen, Salvesen, Tuck strip
theory computer program using Potash
close-fit liydrodynamic force values
was applied to evaluate the coupling
terms from sway and yaw. They were
small for the loaded condi fcion and
large for the ballast condition in
which latter case counteracted uhe
roll motion and the large wave heeling.
moment. The coupling moments were
thus apparently not responsible for
the observed rapid capsize,
However, a hypothesis could be built
up to explain the capsize in terms
of the above causes, by considering
the lagging of the roll motion behind
the other modes in the (then) ultimate
half-roll cycle of this strongly non-
linear system,

propose a method to calculate the

two kinds of models, the hydrodynamic

calculated using these hydrodynamic

The calculated two-dimensional hydro-
dynamic characteristics were confirmed
by the known relation to be accurate
in numerical values and checked very
well the results obtained by the model
experiments.
Through the numerical calculations of
the coupled motions, it was also found
that the effect of the heaving motion

is towed at the same velocity as the phase
velocity of a wave train generated by
means of a wave-generating screen board
attached beneath the towing carriage. The
relative position of the ship to the wave
is fixed at several different positions.
The ship model has a given angle of heel

The righting moment and ship

measured with a 4-component dynamometer.
Next, calculations based on the

To compare the results of the experiment.
The calculations are carried out both with
the effect of the wave orbital velocity
taken into acount and with it neglected.
The Froude-Krylov calculations give
consistent results for the experiment if
the trim and sinkage of the ship on the

firstly the results of statistical analysis

into ten modes corresponding to ship condi-

weather conditions so that the typical patt-
erns and the main causes of capsizing acci-
dents can be clarified.
Secondly, these typical patterns of
capsizing accidents in rough weather are
compared with the model test results carried
out in the seakeeping model basin. The model
experiments confirm that the main causes of
capsizing for small vessels be cargo shift
and shipping water on deck accompanied with
the poor stability of the ship herself.
Casualty records and model experiments show
that the successive attack of large waves
will strongly endanger the ship to capsize.
Such dangerous situations can be expla-
ined by considering the encounter waves in
quartering or following seas and ship motions
in such sea conditions. The author shows an
example of encounter waves measured in foll-
owing seas and deduces that the ship travel-
ling with an irregular wave could be accom-

acked successively by largest waves for a

modal lateral treatment of aircraft
dynamics is used. The inclusion of roll
coupling has provided a better under-
standing of the stability and motions in
high speed manoeuvres and shown that the
traditional approximations do not
adequately describe the behavioul of a
vehicle in that situation.

ship capsizing, the prediction of large
rolling motion in irregular waves must be-
come possible statisfactorily. Of couise
the irregular waves are probabilistic phe-
nomena but the rolling in given irregular
wave is considered to be deterministic.
For this purpose/ the damping and re-
storing force coefficients of a nonlinear
equation of motion including the nonlinear
wave exciting forces in irregular waves
should be given.
But on the present stage, the purely
theoretical estimation on all of those co-
efficients arc nor possible in regular

On the other hand, experimental
studies in regular waves have been made but
experimental studies in irregular waves,

From the model experiments in nigh irregular waves and in high concentrated T.W.W can be
predicted in time domain by using the given
time history of waves. And from this con-
sistent procedure, obtained nonlinear char-

The reason why we adopted the concen-
tracted T.W.W is LhaL it will become an
example of the technique of generating the

Concerning this ship stability and effect of the sail on rolling have been studied. It was confirmed that ‘the Rule on Stability in Japan was applicable for estimating heel angle induced by steady wind and dynamic stability under gusts at the development stage. Effect of a sail on rolling can be dealt with by quasi static approach in conjunction with results of wind tunnel tests. Adding sail damping terms to the equations of motion the ship motion in waves is calculated by the strip theory. From the results of calculation it was evident that rolling amplitudes of a ship with sail decreadsed by 20 % compared ot ordinary ships without sailks at the resonant frequency.However the test result on roll damping of the full scale ship in the actual sea led to a conclusion which was contrary to the results of the prediction methodby reason of excessively low wave height. If forced rolling induced by waves is considerably large there rests the possibilityy that sail damping may be expected to decrease rolling angle. »,

on a full-scale ship, which were estimated
from the ship's measured motions, with the

First, extensive model experiments were

stabilized type semi-submersible platform
model to certify the existence of the steady
tilt and to obtain the corresponding steady
tilt moment by changing the metacentric
height of the model, where the effect of

addition, the model experiments in irregular*

providing a method for predicting the under-
deck clearance, where both the irregular
waves having the ordinary spectrum of the
pierson-MosKowitz type and the regular wave
groups are used.
Second, computations were made
iteratively to obtain the motion spectrum in
roll mode by taking into account the steady
tilt moment established by the model
experiments in regular waves. Further, the
expected values of roll motion and relative
displacement in irregular waves were
predicted by introducing the statistic
process, and those were compared with the
results of model experiments in irregular

of the situation is that a substantial acci-

inevitable that losses will continue to
occur at a significant level, especially for

level of risk? It has to be recognised that
there is no absolute level of acceptable
risk at present and the best that can he
done is to attempt to assess priorities for
action which will give optimum returns for
improved safety.
There are two basic prerequisites to
assess overall priorities for ship safety
first, identification of the main problem
areas/ and second, knowledge of remedial
actions which wilJ be effective. It is
this latter aspect that has concentrated
the mind of the ndval architect for some
considerable time, particularly on matters
such as intact stability* Although the
operational side is recognised to be of
some importance in relation to ship safety
in general, it is the seakeeping qualities
of a vessel that are of vital concern in
dbsebbing an adequate level of intact
stability.
Unfortunately, in recent years there
has been an over emphasis on the theoreti-
cal aspects of ship stability. As a result
little or no thought has been given to the
fundamental requirement of ship stability
assessment from a designers poinL of view.
The best way to overcome this difficulty
is to address the problem of safety in a
more rational way using recent concepts of
reliability analysis and long-term predic-

take into consideration both the vessel

to exit when the gust strikes, is modified. It is now assumed that the wave
action continues even after the gust strikes and ends just before the windward

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) known as the Inter-governmental Maritime Consultative Organization (IMCO) until 20 May 1982, has been working towards the development of physical criteria which would manifestly enable safety assessment relative to external forces and thus provide, for the first time, indications of safety margins.

of probability of occurrences of steep and high waves for
given sea states by using the joint probability density-
distribution of crest front steepness and wave height.
The sea states are described by using a joint frequency
distribution of significant wave height and mean zero-
crossing period. The dominant wave direction is taken from
wind statistics. Then, the operations of the vessel have to be
investigated in order to assess when it is exposed to the
waves, and its loading conditions and associated stability.

wave height, using model experiment data.

Stability
during the transit condition is not a
major factor of semisubmersibles due to
their
large water plane area
(large
restoring moment) in spite of its large
wind overturning moment.
Therefore the
payload capacity in the transit condition
is usually determined by its displacement
regardless of its stability. . But in the
operating and survival conditions
the
stability limit is the crucial factor for
the päyload capacity because of its small
water plane area.
This stability limit
depends on the wind overturning moment and
the stability criteria to be applied. This paper explains the wind tunnel

The contributions of KG, initial heel and initial position of the model relative to the wave to the rolling motion
and capsizing were also investigated.
As for the mechanism of capsizing it is clarified that the model was heeled over the stability vanishing angle
in a large amplitude rolling motion which was mainly excited by a non-impulsive wave exciting force. The spilling
breakers only gave her a small impulsive moment for capsizing, but they played a significant role in terms of
changing the conditions, i.e. heeling angle, angular velocity and so on, to encounter the following critical waves.

a model heading into waves,
repeatable capsizes have been produced for a particular loading of the model and length of wave.

oscillatory surging component, after the decay uf the transitional motion, reaches the phase
velocity of the wave. The speed range ot the ship LS divided into the three parts concerning
the occurence of the surf-riding. Below the first critical speed the ship never makes the
surf-riding but makes always the period:c surgi ng mot1on. Over the second critical speed,
the ship inevitably falls into  the surf-riding condition. Between the two critical speed,
the ship makes either periodic surging or surf-riding motion depending on the initial coondition. As a practical guideline to avoid the dangerous surf-riding, a simple method to
obtain the cri tical ship speed and the critical wave height is proposed. By the analogy with
Other phenomenon such as Josephson effect in the super conductivity, the surf-riding is
suggested to be one of the fundamental nonlinear phenomenon in the physical science. »",

which coupled sway, yaw and roll are admitted in the equations of motion- This approach
reduces artificial constraints, justification for which is not at all clear and the effects
of which are likely to be significant in the ship stability and capsizing phenomena. This

Rolling response functions were calculated for typical fishing vessels in Hoikkaido.

threshold values for on deck situations were obtained using a linear discriminate function.

danger from capsizing. Therefore, a research project

ship encountering a number of steep and almost regular waves. Most capsizes have been observed in following
and quartering seas. In this work, the wave conditions encountered by a ship are characterized in terms of wave
groups that consist of a high run and a low run of waves. In order to study the waves encountered by a ship, the
spectral information measured at a fixed point was transformed to a moving coordinate system. The wave
groups and t^he high runs were then predicted in the moving coordinate system using envelope theory- These and
other properties of the encountered waves were found to depend strongly on the ship speed. Using these results, the
speeds and the headings at which the ship is likely to encounter long high runs were predicted. Critical
conditions were determined by comparing the period and the length of the dominant encountered waves with the
characteristics of the ship. The probability of the ship encountering a critical high run was then determined for a

of ships in oblique waves and effects of shipping water on the stability of
ships is presented. The dynamic swell-up due to the disturbance of orbital
motion of water particles in the oblique waves, named dynamic swell-up due to
the oblique'waves, on the ship's sides in the oblique waves was investigated
theoretically. The critical wave height for deck wetness of ships considering
that effect in the oblique waves was calculated by using the strip method.
The model experiments on the dynamic swell-up due to the oblique waves
were carried out for a model ship with the Lewis form cross sections fixed in
the oblique waves. Another model experimets on the safety of ships in the
waves were carried out for that model ship and a model ship of fishing
vessel.
Numerical results and experimental observation teach us that deck
wetting occurs on a ship when the magnitude of incident waves exceeds the
critical wave height for deck wetness. In such case if deck wetting occurs
repeatedly, some amount of shipping water is accumulated on deck. In this
situation, stationary oscillation around heeling condition and/or capsizing
of the ship occur in waves. »",

national stability criteria, as they are owned and operated as

large sailing vessels have vastly different motion characteristics

outlines the research which was cominissioned by
the Department of Transport (Marine Directorate ) . In particular , the research relates to two series
of ‘damaged’ model tests carried out in waves of
varying significant wave height, with the models
beam-on to on-coming waves. The intention was to
determine critical zones where capsize or non-
capsize was equally probable.At the same time. statical calculations were
performed by computer at the appropriate ship
condition (determined by draught, trim and KG for
the damaged condition ) .
In this manner, a link
was made between the residual

required by the regulations and the dynamic
situation indicated by the test results. The particular set of r&gulations used to make
this comparison are those which came into force

stability standards).
An important conclusion
from an examination of
the results of
this
research is that in order Co provide reasonable
protection against capsize, assuming side damage
occurs in the most critical region of the ship.
the residual stability standard should be at
least that of SOLAS '90. The corollary to this is that Ro Ro f e r r i e s b u i l t

phenomena that may lead to unstable conditions for
vessels that have an inherently low natural roll
period, such as semisubmersibles. When such a
vessel is subjected to a narrow-banded seastate,
second-order rolling moments can be generated
near the natural roll frequency by nonlinear
interactions between neighboring frequency
components of the incident wave. This can excite
large amplitude rolling motions even for relatively
small waves, a phenomenon which has been
observed experimentally. A new method was
developed for analyzng this situation where the roll
motion was considered to be divided into two
distinct components: one corresponding to the
wave excitation frequencies with an amplitude
small in the same sense as the incident waves are
small, and a second component which is not
restricted in amplitude, but is required to be slow in
some sense associated with the bandwidth of the
incident wave spectrum.
A two-parameter
perturbation scheme was used to derive the
mathematical model. In the present work, this
method is applied numerically in the time-domain to
a shiplike shape subjected to wave groups

methodologies of ship controllability and transverse stabilily studies, within the framework of modern dynamical
systems’ theory. Specific nonlinear phenomena are identified as responsible for the onset of broaching
behaviour. Steady-stale and transient responses are invesligated and it is shown how capsize is incurred during

aiming to identify the occurence of a critical condition leading to capsize by considering an
analytical solution of an equivalent linearised equation describing the problem in conjunc-

of this paper is to formulate the problem in a way that enables an analytical solution to
be derived and facilitates an investigation towards identifying the occurence of the critical
condition leading to capsize through comparative studies between the analytical solution
and the results of numerical simulation.
Finally, a method for judging the possibility of ship capsize due to parametric resonance
is proposed based on application of the energy balance method during the critical rolling

groupiness of encounter waves varies according to ship course and speed. The groupiness of ocean
waves itself had been estimated statistically by using characteristic values of wave spectrum. This
method has been applied to the encounter waves, and the variation of the groupiness has been
detennined as a function of V/ T , i.e. ship speed/wave period, in following and quartering seas.
The probability to encounter high run is shown as functions of V/ T and number of runs. It is
concluded that the groupiness or probability to encounter high run becomes higher in a range of
V/ T between 1.0 and 2.0 (kt/sec). »",

structure and availability for using existing port facilities, then mono hull type is used
mainly in high-speed crafts. However, it has been known that a mono hull type craft
occasionally lose the transverse stability with increasing her ahead speed, even though
she possesses adequate stability at rest condition. Despite the relative severity of the
phenomenon, the fundamental characteristics is not known sufiiciently. Though,
there are some studies concern with instability phenomenon based on experimental
method, the mechanism of transverse instability phenomenon is still not clear.
In this paper, in order to make the phenomenon clear, we carried out the numerical
calculations on the transverse instability for dynamic pressures, rolling and yawing
moment acting on a high speed craft, by applying Maruo’s slender ship theory. This
paper deals with a phenomenon on the assumption that the craft has constant speed,
heave, trim and heel angle, and attempts to know the mechanism of the transverse
Instability. »",

regular beam seas. Experiments using a Ro—Ro model demonstrate that different modes
of roll motion coexist and that some of them can exhibit large amplitude motion even
for incident Waves of moderate amplitude. Observations of the experiments suggested
that nonlinear coupling of a. ship and Water-on-deck dominates this phenomenon. We
derive model equations of the nonlinearly coupled motion. Numerical simulations of them
also show coexistence of some modes similar to the experimental results. It should be
emphasized that dynamic effects of water-on-deck on a ship in Waves cause this nonlinear

nmnerical and experimental study on the capsizing of the ferry was carried out to
investigate the cause of the accident. Righting moments for various loading condition
are calculated both in still water and in wave conditions. Capsizing simulations are
perfonned with hydrodynamic coefficients obtained from strip method and nonlinear
restoring moments considering relative motion using Runge-Kutta fourth-order method.
It is found out that deterioration of designed righting moment causes ships to capsize
in severe wave conditions. Nonlinear effects such as hydrodynamic forces due to
change of attitude of a ship, effects of green water and freeing ports which are not

conducted in beam seas.
Capsize only occurred with a small GM value, which did not
satisfy SOLAS Regulation.
In non-capsize conditions the ship became a stationary
condition, with constant mean values of heel angle ¢,, and water volume on deck wo.
The effect of experimental parameters on these values and the capsize conditions were discussed.
The effect of resonance of roll motion was also discussed.
The importance of it was
clarified because ¢O, wo and some other data often had peaks in regular waves near the
resonant frequency.
The mean height of water on deck above the calm sea surface H4, which almost kept a
certain plus value, was proposed as an index for the stationary condition-

and difficult to analyze. Under the wrong conditions, water can
accumulate in the ship and ultimately capsize it. Physical models provide
the opportunity to study the water flow in and around the hull, and the
subsequent behaviour of the ship, without the risk to life or property. The
resulting ship models are relatively complex because they must represent
the external and intemal geometries of the ship and require measurements
of body motions, wave amplitudes, and more recently water flow inside
the hull. This paper briefly traces the development of this type of
modelling, with particular reference to RO—RO ferries. Two types of
damage scenario are identified, one as a result of a collision and one as a
result of loss or damage to the bow door. The paper then discusses the
state of the art for modelling the capsize survivability of
damaged ships, based on experience with this type of testing. The
minimum technical requirements for the construction of the model, the
generation of Waves, the conduct of the experiments and the presentation
of the results are discussed in detail. Some suggestions for areas of further
research in this extremely important area of ship hydrodynamics are also
Given. »",

discussed. Severity of damage is measured by the size of damage opening. Required safety
depends on the value lost if the ship sinks. A safer ship will be the one that can survive a
larger damage opening, anywhere over its hull. In impact damage, size of damage opening
will be influenced by the strength of structure at the region of impact. Survivability after
damage, in a sea state, is to be assessed by a Capsizing Probability, considering also the
effect of Water shipped into the damaged region and ‘the fluctuating restoring ability of
the ship in waves. »",

enhancing the insight into one of the most dominant parameters affecting the survival of a Ro-Ro
vessel, the water accumulation on the vehicle deck. The investigation represents an attempt to
identify the most important contributing factors to the flooding process by performing a series of
experiments using a scaled model of a typical Ro-Ro vessel. The matrix considered involves a
range of ship design and environmental parameters in a number of simplified damage scenarios,
starting with a fixed model and progressively introducing more degrees of freedom, building up to
more realistic damages in a way that allows for isolation of individual contributions to the water
accumulation on the Ro-Ro deck. The results of the experiments are presented and discussed,
leading to recommendations for characterising the flooding process for general assessment of
damage survivability. »",

and theoretical motion simulations in irregular seaways.
The simulation combines nonlinear equations for roll and surge motions with a linear
treatment of heave, pitch, sway, and yaw, using the strip method. The rate of inflow
and outflow of water through the damage opening is estimated from the relative motion
between ship and external water surface, so that the volume of water in each damaged
compartment is corrected at each time step. Special emphasis was placed on simulating
realistically the motion of water on deck. The forces and moments due to the fluid motion
in partly flooded rooms and on the vehicle deck are determined and added to the external
forces and moments due to wave excitation, wind etc.
A series of model tests of the survivability of damaged ro-ro ships was carried out at HSVA
in accordance with the “Model Test Method” required by IMO. For three ships, and with
different subdivisions on the ro-ro deck, damage positions and drafts, the limit between safe
and unsafe centre of gravity positions is determined by testing with different KG—values.
At present the results for one ship are available.
Based on the results of model tests and motion simulations, fundamental relationships
between capsizing safty of damaged ro-ro ships and form parameters of the ship, locations
of the damage and vehicle deck subdivisions can been established. The simulation method
was comprehensively validated by comparisons with the model tests. Due to the quite
convincing coincidence found, it appears justified to predict the behaviour of a damaged
ship in other conditions by our simulation. »",

accumulation of shipping water on deck. The amount of water on deck and
heeling/rolling angle were measured. As wave height increased, the water level
became higher and the model was led to capsize.
In the paper, the cases of unstable motion are considered in viewpoint of dynamic
stability, taking into account shipping water on deck. As the results, it is concluded
that the critical condition for capsizing can be determined on the GZ-curve by taking
into account the effect of shipping water on the dynamic
stability. This method is
simple and easy to apply to actual ships. Therefore, this criteria can be an alternative
to the ""Static Equivalent Method"" which has
been proposed by the North European
countries to the SLF/IMO. »",

but also dynamic effects of flooded water.

a high-speed craft in calm water carried out by the authors are reviewed.
It is experimentally confirmed that the transverse stability significantly de-
creases at high Froude number, and this causes large heel of a craft. The stability
loss, which depends on trim angle, also generates roll motion when a craft has
pitching motion. It is found that porpoising of the craft is a self-exciting motion
due to the different sign of the coupling restoring coefficients between pitch and
heave motion. Finally prediction methods for the roll and pitch damping including
vertical lift force contribution are proposed. »",

roll amplitudes corresponding to the exciting moment at given sea state and sailing conditions.
The phenomenon is considered on the basis of modern theory of ship motions and the
corresponding numerical measure for this ship quality is found. Namely it is assumed to use
the amplitude of steady parametric rolling motion as such a measure. Finally it is suggested
the new idea to check ship stability in following seaway condition by means of the criterion
which supposes to restrict above mentioned parametric roll amplitude. »",

effort has been laid down by the regulatory bodies to enhance the stability regulations, most
notably the “SOLAS 90” standard and the “Stockholm Agreement”. This paper discusses the
impact of these standards on the overall ship safety by using an example ship before SOLAS
90, after upgrading to SOLAS 90 and according to the Stockholm Agreement. The
comparison is based on calculation of the subdivision index using the proposed framework
from the Joint North-West European research project on Safety of Passenger/R0-Ro vessels.

using linear ideal flow theory ship motions computer
programs, roll motion is not. This is because roll
damping is generally small and the ideal flow part is a
small part of that. (see Faltinsen, 1990). Accurately
predicting the roll damping is the key to accurately
predicting the roll motion. The most common methods
are to use 1) empirical data mostly from Japan based
upon exclusive series model test (Ikeda, 2002) or 2)
Free decay model tests of vessel to determine damping.
In addition recent progress has also occurred in
predicting ship roll damping using computational fluid
dynamics (CFD) (e.g., Korpus & Falzarano, 1997). The
Reynolds Averaged Navier – Stokes CFD alternative
has the potential to accurately predict full-scale roll
damping, but is completely dependent upon the
turbulence modeling. In this paper we suggest a simple
method to at least approximately extrapolate roll
damping to full scale. Our approximate method
borrows Froude hypothesis from ship resistance testing
to separately scale friction and residuary damping
(wave & eddy) using Reynolds and Froude scaling
Respectively. »",

three main purposes of the Organization includes “to encourage the general adoption of the highest
practicable standards in matters concerning maritime safety and efficiency of navigation”. As
Chairman of SLF, I see this as meaning that my Sub-Committee is responsible for encouraging
research into stability and load line matters and ensuring that, where practicable, the outcomes of
that research are reflected in the relevant IMO regulations.
The practicality aspect cannot be over-emphasised with regard to successful regulatory measures
based on research outcomes. Clearly, these issues are best addressed, and optimum outcomes
achieved, through the cooperative efforts of not only researchers and regulators, but also the
industry groups to whom the responsibility for implementation of measures ultimately falls.
But the resulting regulations must be sufficiently robust to provide for uniform safety outcomes,
irrespective of who is using the regulations and the tools applied in their implementation.
The procedures adopted by IMO require regulatory results to be produced within a finite time.
Accordingly, finalisation of regulations cannot be delayed to await conclusive outcomes from
research work, other than in exceptional circumstances.
In order to learn from previous work, I will provide some examples are given of the success or
otherwise of the translation of previous research work into IMO regulations.
I will also provide my assessment of the current items on the SLF work programme for which
stability-related research is a necessary basis for the resulting IMO regulations.
The key to success in these endeavours is cooperation between researchers, regulators and
industry throughout the process of identifying areas of compelling need for action, setting and
translating achievable goals, through research, into meaningful improvements to maritime safety.",

the Weather Criterion in new revised Intact Stability (IS) Code. In this study, the procedure of the
model test in the Interim Guidelines was reviewed by carrying out the model test and analyzing the
test results. To do this, RO/RO passenger ship whose ratios of breadth to draft and the height of
weight to draft were more than 3.5 and 0.5 respectively was selected as a test ship. Drifting test and
motion test in regular waves were performed to estimate hydrodynamic heeling lever and roll-back
angle. As the drifting test results, hydrodynamic heeling lever was changed in terms of heel angles,
while it was not influenced by the small change of drifting speed. Motion tests in waves were
carried out in the three wave steepness conditions to measure roll-back angle and examine the
feasibility of so called, the Three-step method. Using the test data, the Weather Criterion was
assessed for the test ship by using alternative method and compared with the current method. »",

and drifting tests for evaluating wind heeling lever, l w1 , and roll tests in waves for evaluating the roll
angle, φ 1 , were conducted. The results showed some difference from the current estimation, for
example the wind heeling moment depended on heel angle and the centre of drift force existed
higher than half draft. The weather criterion was assessed for allowable combinations of these
results and the effect of experiment-supported assessment on the critical KG and so forth was
Discussed. »",

the proposed measures to bring the platform to a situation of even keel fluctuation. The support
team stayed on duty 24 hours, supplying analyses of the situation of the platform and comparing

production has been increasing at high rate. As a result, there was a boost of production units
operated by Petrobras. Due to projects and operation complexity and the large number of contractor
companies, problems related to data management on Naval Architecture were observed.
Furthemore, due to fleet enlargement, difficulties regarding modifications on SPUs (Stationary
Production Units) were also observed. Bearing this scenario in mind, it was decided to create a data
management project to deal with the Naval Architecture aspects of offshore projects. Such
management, in addition to its capacity to deal with the aforementioned problems, would provide
assistance on emergency events.
The GIEN (Naval Architecture Integrated Management) project implementation was based on
SPUs documentation revision, the development of a follow-up tool to manage modifications carried
on onboard, the upload of all data on a single homepage, the emergency services rendered by a
SALVAGE company and the engineering support provided by Classification Societies technical
divisions.
This paper describes in an abridged form, the present situation of the GIEN project on Petrobras.

be of concern principally in following seas and for small, low freeboard ships. In the 1990s,

rolling in head seas. These were ships having a hull form characterized by great flare forward and
wide flaring stern sections, features that are known to lead to significant stability variations in

make continues hindcasting (30 and longer years duration) of directional spectra for any region and

operations, offshore supplying etc spatiotemporal variability of wave fields may be also estimated.
One of the most interesting extreme phenomena is freak (or rogue) waves. Freak wave is unusual
not only by there height, but by their form. Results of hindcasting do not display any suspicion to a
freak wave as this is a single wave. Classical statistical approach to analysis of time series do not

relevant bifurcation condition was mathematically formulated and then a numerical procedure for
obtaining its solution was presented with successful example. This identified bifurcation condition
was compared with direct numerical simulation in time domain. As a result, it was confirmed that
the heteroclinic bifurcation provides a boundary between motions periodically overtaken by waves
and non-periodic motions such as surf-riding, broaching and so on. Then a local bifurcation analysis

riding and oscillatory surf-riding as a Hopf bifurcation. Furthermore, comparison with free-running
model experiments shows some discrepancies and an improvement with an aid of nonlinearity in
wave-induced surge force is presented. »",

floodwater in the time domain are obtained by solving the shallow water flow equations. The
numerical model is then applied to study the behaviour of a flooded passenger ro-ro ship. A number
of damage conditions are studied which include the flooding of double-bottoms and main

waters and beam waves, both in the intact and damage conditions. Comparisons with experimental

metre-long cruising yacht in September 2003 in Japan. Responding to the request from Japan’s
Marine Accident Inquiry Agency the authors executed a model experiment in beam wind for
identifying the time-to-sink as well as stability calculations with and without water inside the yacht.
The results indicate it could capsize when the wind velocity exceeds a threshold. Because of an
opened hatch on the deck, water initially enters into the cabin. After capsizing, the water ingress
process stops. However, if wind is strong enough to incline the capsized yacht, the yacht starts to
return to upright condition but this transition stage provides an opportunity to further flooding. By
systematically changing wind velocity in the experiment, the time to sink was recorded. In
conclusion, the critical wind velocities for capsizing and sinking were estimated, and reasonably

availability of drill rigs, existing rigs are being upgraded for operating in water depths greater that
their original design limits. When an upgrade of this type is performed, the stability issue is a
critical one. The loading demand increases and usually extra flotation is required. There is an
increase in mooring loads, riser tension, mud and bulk capacity, steel weight of derrick and cranes
of greater capacity.
We can divide the rig’s loading in mooring and drilling loads, payload and lightweight. The first
two vary mainly with the environmental conditions and the water depth. These can be optimized by
using the correct conditions for the site location and by choosing adequate materials and solutions.
The second comes from the augmented storage capacity of drilling necessities, and this is the main
demand for an upgrade in the rig. The optimization in this case can only come from reduced vcg
obtained with an optimized arrangement of weight distribution. The third is a consequence that
comes from the increase in equipment capacities, additional reinforcements, etc. This can also be
optimized in the concept design of the upgrade, such as choice of environmental conditions,
materials and equipment, dismantling of existing unnecessary items and optimization in the
structural reinforcements.
A statistical analysis of many upgrades performed presents the impact of each of these items.
We can analyze how each item like the choice for dynamic positioning, vertical riser storage, and
the dimensioning for adequate environmental conditions can affect the viability of the project.

become clear that the quadratic or even the cubic model to describe the damping of the rolling mode
may not match with reduced model decaying tests. This has been shown in the past and is
confirmed by several recent model tests. An alternative, named the bilinear approach has been
suggested and that has conducted to a very good match between mathematical model and tests. By
the bilinear model, the roll damping behavior is divided in two assumed linear regions, and the
transition is made around the so-called transition angle. This is clear for sections with wider bilge
keels which are presently a trend in the offshore industry. It is shown that despite being non-linear,
due to the simplicity of the bilinear model the differential equation for the decaying test has an
explicit solution and the matching with experiments is almost exact. How to obtain the transition
angle experimentally is discussed in the paper. Several tests are shown and both the quadratic model
and the bilinear approaches are applied and compared. It is proposed that typical decaying tests for
vessels with this kind of sections, additionally to the usual linear plus quadratic coefficients, the
tests should also provide the two linear damping coefficients, the transition angle and also the

under environmental loads in an ultra deep water scenario. A floating platform connected to the sea
bottom by a long slender pipe is taken into account. Current and wave acting on the floating
platform and along the riser length are considered.
Numerical simulation in time domain has been developed using a non-linear model for the
floating platform dynamics with an ultra deep drilling riser. Dynamics of a drilling riser and the
dynamic positioning system (DPS) of the platform are also included in the numerical model.
Simulation results in time domain for the floating platform motion with DP control and riser
displacement behavior are shown. Discussions in terms of riser design and optimization of dynamic
positioning system control are carried out. »",

on numerical solution of non-linear equations of motion. Theoretical model of the influence of wa-
ter on car deck, used in analyses of stability safety of Ro-Ro ships, is adopted to calculate the vol-
ume of water shipping on the weather deck and flowing out of the deck well. However, computa-
tional model of pressure imposed by water on deck is modified and improved.
Simulations of small fishing vessel motions in various irregular waves have been carried out.
They proved usefulness of systematic simulations for future development of Goal Based Standards
for safety of small vessels. Some general conclusions regarding the application of water-on-deck
model, which was developed for Ro-Ro ships, to evaluation of the influence of water-on-deck on
small vessel safety are presented. »",

displacement and center of gravity. Besides upgrading work, the very operation of the platform with
constant ballast and oil loading and unloading or the use of maintenance equipment can generates
uncertainties related to the displacement and the center of gravity. These, therefore, are the
parameters that present uncertainties inherent to the vessel’s operations, taking this into account,
one example of uncertainties application on the displacement and the transversal and vertical
positions of the center of gravity will be presented, in the analysis of the static stability of a
converted fpso tanker another question raised in this work is the deterministic treatment of certain
criteria for the parameters that depends on random factors, such as the wind, currents and waves.
This paper will present a probabilistic approach for the calculation of the roll angle according to
resolution imo a562 (environment criteria), the two chosen criteria for this analysis were resolutions

determined for what is called the weakest axis, which is not necessarily the same as the longitudinal
axis of symmetry of the structure. When allowing trim to take place, the determination of the
critical axis is complicated as free trimming leads to multiple solutions regarding the position for a
given heel angle. It will be shown that for a freely floating structure, looking at the increase in
potential energy can be used to identify those axis directions which are critical as well as realistic.
The theoretical results will be illustrated with detailed data obtained for a two typical offshore
structures using a standard stability program. »",

interest in the righting arms beyond the maximum on the righting arm curve. With this trend, we
find with increasing frequency abnormalities hat are caused by the simplifications in the existing
methods. Of these abnormalities, the most disconcerting we call fading stability. In the research on
fading stability we have found that conventional “free-to-trim” stability calculation can lead to
incorrect results and that the steepest descent method (SDM) is the correct methodology.
This paper will present the progress of the methods applied to stability analysis, the weakness of
previous and current methods, the rational and mathematical basis for the proposed methodology.
Lessons learned with SDM and the benefits of the application to the analysis to all types of hulls

stability; as some of the new designs have a tendency to exhibit undesirable behavior in waves. The
primary reason for this behavior is a radical departure from conventional hull shapes. Existing
stability criteria were developed for conventional hull shapes and there is a need for tools to assess
if there are problems with dynamic stability, preferably early in the design process. This situation
has motivated the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to start development of the next
generation of stability criteria, which includes tools for early assessment of the vulnerability of a
new design to dynamic stability failure. This paper considers the second level of vulnerability
assessment, when simple but physics-based approaches are used to assess the modes of stability
failure, still early in the design process. A framework is discussed to address the problems
concerning the choice of wave conditions and determining the probability of failure for each
stability mode. »",

to the dynamic performance of the vessel in waves is little known.
A methodology has been developed to evaluate the dynamic stability performance of naval vessels
after damage. The evaluation of the current criteria has been performed using a large number of time-
domain ship motion simulations using a computer program capable of simulating a damaged vessel
with subsequent water ingress and flooding. This gives an insight into the level of safety inherent in the
current damage stability standards.
A selection of damage cases were conducted using a frigate hullform with geometric variations
made to the internal subdivision. A range of loading conditions from those passing the current criteria
through to those failing in each of the geometric damage case variations were systematically assessed
in a range of wave conditions representative of post-damage sea states. The results from the dynamic
study were then compared to the current damage stability criteria terms to identify how the current

•
•
•
The gathering of information on the environmental conditions, the ship’s load condition, deck

The reproduction of the ship’s characteristics at model scale with special emphasis on the deck
arrangement: obstructions, gunwales, openings on sides and deck, and so on.
The reproduction of the wave conditions and specially the way in which specific deterministic
waves are chosen with a certain probability of having occurred in the sea state estimated at the

quartering waves with nonlinear dynamics using a surge-sway-yaw-roll simulation model. As a
result, a standard bifurcation technique of periodic orbits confirmed the occurrence of the
phenomenon as a flip bifurcation, which had been identified in the previous works. The calculation
of Lyapunov exponents demonstrates that this phenomenon could result in chaos via a Feigenbaum
cascade. The experimental record of this phenomenon is also presented with a physical model of
the ONR tumblehome. Further, to prevent this phenomenon, an optimal control theory is applied.
Here the optimal control law was numerically obtained by a nonlinear programming technique for
minimising the performance index, which is defined as the variance of yaw angle. The obtained
control successfully prevents the occurrence of yaw instability. This suggests, if this conclusion is
widely applicable for ships, that this low-speed broaching could be avoided by appropriate
operation so that it could be noted in physics-based operational guidance but it does not have to be
included in a design criterion. »",

dynamics. It will be shown in this paper the importance of accurately modeling not only the
important hydrostatic restoring moments but also the importance of accurately modeling the
radiated wave force. It is well known in the marine hydrodynamics field that the radiated wave
force is frequency dependent. However, much work in the nonlinear marine dynamical systems
field has assumed frequency independence or a constant coefficients approximation. Assuming
constant coefficients may be a reasonable approximation for single frequency steady state motion
and even the transient response of a nonlinear system with a single frequency excitation but clearly
not for multiple frequency excitation. In this work we will assess the effect of approximating the
radiated wave force by constant coefficients versus the more accurate impulse response function
modeling. We will apply these two types of hydrodynamic force modeling to calculate critical
dynamics of ship rolling motion in regular and irregular waves. The critical dynamics are directly
determined using a unique calculation method (Vishnubhotla, Falzarano, Vakakis, 2000). This
method directly calculates motions on either the stable and unstable manifolds. Since the stable
manifolds form the basin boundaries, the safe basin can be defined. Moreover, this method can be
used as an alternative to the so-called Melnikov method by directly calculating the distance between
the stable and unstable manifolds. This method is potentially more powerful than Melnikov
methods since is it not dependent upon the so-called “Melnikov trick” which practically limits the
Melnikov method to first order. This paper will contain results of constant coefficients (for various
constant frequencies) versus impulse response function for regular wave excitation and various

possibility. The fact that all the sea spectra used by naval architects can be reduced to a common

density functions of certain types. Such spectra, contrary to ITTC ones, are narrow-banded, with the

are caused by heave motions. A split-time approach is used, in which capsizing is considered as a
sequence of two random events: upcrossing through a certain threshold (non-rare problem) and
capsizing after upcrossing (rare problem). To reflect the time-varying stability, a critical roll rate is
introduced as a stochastic process defined at any instant of time. Capsizing is then associated with
an upcrossing when the instantaneous roll rate exceeds the critical roll rate defined for the instant of
upcrossing. A self-consistency check of the method, in which a statistical frequency of capsizing

nor is it possible to deal with the drastic increase in societal expectation on the accepted level of
risk. The new probabilistic regulations for damage stability that came into force in January 2009 is a
sign that the shipping industry in general has made a shift in the way of thinking but even this is
scratching the tip of the amounting need to rethink, reformulate and resolve how to curtail safety
and environmental problems and to enhance both cost-effectively. New methods have to be
deployed, using knowledge in all forms, rather than having to wait for major accidents to happen to
enrich current statistics and henceforth take action. These methods should be able to quickly
evaluate different designs in all aspects of their performance. Goal-Based Design, as opposed to
Risk-Based Design, suggests that the design focus is on balancing all pertinent goals rather than
focusing on risk reduction and mitigation alone. In this process, safety would still have to be
accounted for as a design objective so that it can be dealt with in an early stage in the design process
when it is mostly inexpensive but performance and life-cycle issues must be an integral part of any
decision making. »",

shaped barge which has been used as ITTC validation model. The most important aim of this
research is to find out about the time-to-flood of damaged vessels. Therefore floodwater dynamics
and water ingress through various openings and opening shapes in the ship superstructure are
accounted.
Starting point of this research is a thorough review of the available literature striking models and
methods, which assess damage stability and survivability of passenger ships, aiming to identify
strength and weaknesses of existing theories. Based on this knowledge it is decided to utilise
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) which gives to date more information and details of the
physics of progressive flooding than any other numerical method. A commercial numerical CFD
code is used to create a set-up with appropriate boundary conditions.
In this approach, it is attempted to account for all possible physical effects with state-of-the art
numerical methods. Depending on the geometry of the model, compressible air is used in the
simulation, where trapped air is expected or, where the influence of trapped air could be crucial.
Moreover, a k- turbulence model is adopted in areas of high flow velocities in order to model the
water and air flow through the damage opening and internal openings as true-to-life as possible.
Additionally, a six degrees-of-freedom solver has been integrated which simulates ship motions by
grid remeshing and grid smoothing methods.
The numerical model described in this paper represents the most advanced treatment to date of
modelling the process of progressive flooding with the use of CFD. It can be concluded that the
applied method agrees perfectly with all validation cases and that accuracy is satisfactory though
simulations with simplified models are carried out. Inferential, the prediction of time-to-flood is
mainly derived in a period where the ship remains in quasi-hydrostatic conditions. »",

maneuvering in waves, and large-amplitude roll damping. In the VV&A arena, the challenge
remains for performing this function for extreme seas conditions, where linear concepts such as
response amplitude operators are not applicable. The challenge of performance-based criteria results
from the fact that it is on the leading edge of our knowledge base. »",

application of wind overturning moment, equilibrium angles, downflooding and range of stability.
A discussion of the various ways to calculate the righting arms is given together with problems met
in practice like backward sloping curves and heel angles for which the rig is unstable in trim or axis
direction. The use of the gain in potential energy is investigated as a means to arrive at realistic
righting arm curves. Though this suggests that free twist (or varying axis direction) is the preferred
method, it is not without problems of its own. At this moment there does not seem to be a robust
way to calculate stability other than using fixed trim (read: zero trim) and a fixed axis direction.
It is proposed to do (more) research into the actual reasons for a MODU to capsize due to
environmental loading, preferably by model testing with wind and waves. »",

smaller than that of a conventional one with square cross sections. Therefore large resonant roll
motion can be expected in higher waves. It is also confirmed that Ikeda’s prediction method of the

casualties. For effective risk mitigation, an insight into the process of risk escalation is needed. This
requires a proactive approach when it comes to risk modelling for maritime transportation systems.

claimed of being reactive instead of proactive.
This paper introduces a systematic, transferable and proactive framework estimating the risk for
maritime transportation systems, meeting the requirements stemming from the formal definition of
risk, which is adopted. The framework focuses on ship-ship collisions in the open sea, with a
RoRo/Passenger ship (RoPax) being considered as the struck ship. It is developed with the use of

The development of this new regulation has been an opportunity to completely re-evaluate the way
of calculating damage stability which has resulted in a much more rigorous and thorough
methodology to evaluate the damage stability of ships, especially for passenger ships. Furthermore,
the adoption of a probabilistic method has tremendously increased the amount and complexity of
the work required by the designer to ensure compliance to the rule.
Besides the more typical work on subdivision and hydrostatic calculations, this new regulation
which considers that any compartment may be flooded has had a significant impact on other parts of
ship design such as piping and ventilation ducts. This implies that other design departments in the
shipyard need to be involved from early design stages to detailed studies and verifications on board.

probability of failure that is a part of a formal safety assessment. The alignment of the vulnerability
criteria can be done through the safety level. It is more challenging because of the limited amount of
information available for vulnerability criteria (especially on the first level) and requirements for
simplicity of mathematical models. Nevertheless, the use of the wave group theory approach and
previous work of one the authors along with upcrossing theory allow formulation of such a method. »",

roll motions – confidence interval of the variance estimate. The paper revisits the derivation of the
formula for the variance of the sample variance of a stationary stochastic process in order to re-
examine the assumptions, especially the one related to the process having a normal distribution. The
relation between the formula and the confidence interval based on treating the variance estimate of
different records as separate data points is also considered. »",

flooding and in the design of ships to resist capsize/sinking post-accident, there is very little to show by
way of a systematic approach how to deal with a flooding emergency. Damage control, evacuation, LSA,
rescue are all topics attracting a great deal of attention but how all this fits in and is accounted for during
the design stage and how effective these are post-accident in a way that this can be assessed quantitatively
and accounted for in addressing life-cycle risk is all embryonic. An attempt to delve in this direction is
presented in this paper. The concept used as a building block is ship vulnerability. »",

As an
alternative to medication we created an artificial Earth-fixed matrix of 3D crosses on a display,
possibly augmented with a track showing the (predicted) way ahead. To test this display we
performed two experiments on a motion platform, one showing instantaneous ship motion only, the
other showing both instantaneous and coming aircraft motion. Sickness decreased with visual
feedback of instantaneous motion in both experiments up to a factor of two, where added
anticipatory motion reduced sickness to over a factor of four. »",

characterized by vigorous ship motions, the vast majority of (full mission) bridge simulators are
Earth fixed. We therefore evaluated the value of adding motion to ship simulation in terms of
technical feasibility, measurability of performance, and effects on training. Of eighteen navy
personnel, nine received a 30 min training session with and nine without physical motion in a
bridge simulator. Pre and post tests showed no objective effect on training performance.
Subjectively, however, physical motion was judged beneficial. »",

Here is a synthesis about our experience on naupathia treatment on one hundred and ten sailors
suffering from acute symptoms with incoercible vomiting and no results with classical therapeutics.
Once evaluated the motion sickness according to Graybiel & Miller’s scale, those marines were
proposed optokinetic stimulations based on 10 sessions of thirty minutes per week.
After sailing for over a month, the evolution of results are quantified using the Graybiel & Miller’s
scale and a three item- questionnaire.
Today, we are able to say that Optokinetic stimulation rehabilitation in preventing naupathia found
significant improvements. Not all patients can be cured, of course, but improvements are noticeable. »",
