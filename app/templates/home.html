<p>Welcome on the stability application.<br/>This application give access to a search engine (implemented on
    Elasticsearch technology)
    on a scientific stability corpus
    based on two sub corpuses: the STAB and ISSW corpus which respectively exists since 1975 and 1995.</p>
<h2>Presentation of the corpus</h2>
<div>
    <p>Since the beginning of SRDC (Stability Research & Development Committee) efforts was done to work on papers from
        STAB and ISSW congresses. <br/>
        Because it seemed that nobody have the complete set of proceedings, the first step was to centralised
        proceedings of all conferences from
        the first STAB conference in 1975 and the first ISSW in 1995 both in Glasgow. With helps of all it was possible
        with reasonable efforts to find a version,
        at least a paper version for oldest years, of all congress and workshops. </p>
    <!-- On affiche le nombre de documents prÃ©sents au moment de la connexion sur le cluster.-->
    <p>For now, there is a total of {{ response.count }} documents accessible on the search app.</p>

<h2>Simple research</h2>
<div>
    <form action="/" method="post" autocomplete="off">
        <label for="q">Your research: </label><input type="text"
                                                     placeholder="Enter an expression"
                                                     name="q"
                                                     id="q" value="{{q}}" required>
        <button type="submit" value="search">Search</button>
    </form>
    <p class="explanation">This search will grab every document where the first word of your
        request is followed by the next one and so on.<br/>
        For instance, the request "Bernoulli's equation" will search all the document where "Bernoulli's" is immediately
        followed by "equation".<br>
        The research is made over the entire document, metadata included.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div>
    <form action="/fulltext" method="post" autocomplete="off">
        <label for="query">Your research: </label><input type="text"
                                                         placeholder="Enter your keyword"
                                                         name="query"
                                                         id="query" value="{{query}}" required>
        <button type="submit" value="search">Search</button>
    </form>
    <p style="font-size: 12px; font-style: italic;">This search option will research each word separately on every
        document of the cluster. It will not search on the metadata of the document. <br/>
        For instance, the request "Bernoulli's equation" will search "Bernoulli's", then "equation" on each document
        which will end up with a larger number of results but a smaller relevant score.
        <br>
        The research is made over the entire document, metadata included.</p>
